Hello, dear reader, I would really appreciate any feedback, feel free to message me (my email is on my profile).

The aim of this app is to dive deep into CNN architecture while having fun at the same time. The text is intended for a broader audience, so it skips many technical details about CNNs. However, I'm not entirely sure about the actual breadth of the intended audience.

Originally, I planned to include a Grad-CAM heatmap, but I couldn't get this feature to work on Streamlit for some unknown reason. As a result, that part of the code is commented out for now.

I’m not entirely proud of some parts of the code, but due to personal reasons, I had to finish this project today.

I’m also unsure whether I should write documentation for this... Did anyone even have a chance to read this text? What do you think?
